It was difficult on how to parse the data to a java object

It is better to seperate your methods out into different classes to have better object oriented code


5. After completing the assignments this week, what questions do you still have?
I am still a bit unclear how to move JSON String objects to a class object. It worked in my code for the current weather conditions but not the 5 day forcast.


6. Aside from the task you completed, what is another use you could see for the API we used?
You can setup the API to notify you of increment weather that is upcoming


7. A common Java interview question is "Describe what an API is and how it's used". (Sometimes people refer to these types of APIs as "REST APIs") How would you answer that question?
An api is a way for a program to call on an external source to request and retrieve data.
